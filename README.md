## Approach to Software Design
For this project I followed an agile design process. This was my first-time using OpenGL, and I have no experience designing 3D applications, so I basically implemented one feature at a time. After implementing a feature, I performed testing, and then completed any finishing touches on the feature. The features were driven by the requirements each week. So, it was easy to follow every week, implementing the features in line with requirements. This process is something I used in other classes, and I was able to hone and solidify this tactic that will help me future classes.

## Approach to Program Development
In addition to weekly assignments, we were expected to implement parts of the project as milestone objectives. This helped in following an agile, iterative approach to software development. For example, the first milestone was simply getting objects of different shapes into the scene. The next milestone built on this and included additional requirements that are part of a 3D scene, such as adding a camera. A following milestone included adding lighting to the scene. So the milestones flowed naturally with an iterative development cycle. During each milestone, I wrote out the requirements, then coded, then tested, and polished off the final implementation. This made the entire development process much smoother, because we would not want to develop the entire project and then test at the end.

## Computer Science and Goals
The skills I learned in this class are multi-dimensional. First, I had very little experience with OpenGL and programming 3D applications, so this experience alone has given me new skills. Secondly, while the project may not seem major, it still required a lot of thought and development process to implement. From a technical perspective, this was still a technical project, and required the ability to plan and figure out how to solve problems. So my technical and problem solving skills have improved.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. I really like working with C++, so this made OpenGL fun to work with as well. OpenGL is amazing! I am really impressed with how it works, and how it enables us to build 2D and 3D applications.
